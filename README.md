The Inertial Sense [EVB-2](https://docs.inertialsense.com/user-manual/hardware/EVB2/) is a development board which contains the Inertial Sense µINS, µAHRS, or µIMU module. The EVB-2 builds on the foundation established by the EVB-1, but adds these and other new features:

- 915MHz Xbee radio for RTK (real-time-kinematics)
- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low energy (BLE) for remote data viewing and logging operation
- Onboard logging to micro SD card.
- Dual antenna ports for GPS compassing
- Companion Microchip SAME70 processor that serves as a communication bridge between the µINS, µAHRS, or µIMU and all other interfaces.
